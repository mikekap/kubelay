================

An attempt at exposing a graphql API to kubernetes. This is *pre-alpha* software - pull requests wanted.

For development
```
npm run-script app:server:start:dev &
npm run-script app:webpack:start
```

And navigate to http://localhost:4444/ . You can also use http://localhost:4444/graphql to browse around the schema.
