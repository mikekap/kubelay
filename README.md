# isomorphic-[react](https://facebook.github.io/react/)-[relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)-boilerplate

**Work in progress!**

This project is more like a `tutorial` on how to quickly build an isomorphic app based on [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) and [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/). In Node.js we are used to split complex all-in-one applications into several smaller ones. Thus our code is easier to read, easier to maintain and projects become long-term sustainable.

Every implementation step of this boilerplate is documented under the `docs` directory so you can build everything from scratch.

# Start

1. Follow the [implementation steps](docs) or just clone this repository.
2. Start HTTP server: `server:start:dev`.
3. Start Webpack server: `webpack:start`.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4444`.
